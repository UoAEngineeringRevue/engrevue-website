The landing page website used to promote and document the University of Auckland Engineering Revue, the coolest student-run variety comedy theatre show in the vicinity of 20 Symonds Street.

## Development

This project is built with Gatsby. To run the development server, use:

`gatsby develop`

Changes are automatically deployed to Netlify upon committing to the `master` branch.

## Roadmap

### MVP

### Short-term future
* **Sponsor Us** page: promotion of the Revue to potential future sponsors
* Ticket sales, when that inevitably happens

### Long-term future
* **History** page: detailed historical timeline of the creation of the Revue and its changes from 2008 to today
* Mailing list to contact potential patrons with promotional material and ticket sales information (subject to any potential cost/data privacy issues)
